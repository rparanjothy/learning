Supervised learning - we give inputs to the algorithm and also tell what input maps to what output.

2 types of problems:
Classification problem and Regression Problems

In classification, the possible outputs are called "Classes", if there are N types of outputs, its called "N Class Classification" problem.

For a particular observation, the class it belongs to / the output is called "Label"
